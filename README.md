# Star Pulse

Star Pulse is a rhythm-based survival game where players control a satellite orbiting a pulsing star. The goal is to avoid colliding with asteroids by switching orbits in sync with the star’s pulse. Survive as long as possible to achieve a high score!

## How to Play

- Wait for the star (`*`) to pulse (turns red every 2 seconds).
- During the pulse, press **Arrow Up** to move to an inner orbit or **Arrow Down** to move to an outer orbit.
- Avoid **asteroids (`A`)** orbiting the star.
- Your score increases the longer you survive.
- The game ends if your satellite (`O`) collides with an asteroid.

## Game Features

- **Rhythm-Based Gameplay:** Time your orbit changes to the star’s pulse for precise dodging.
- **Minimalist ASCII Graphics:** Uses simple text characters on a canvas for a retro aesthetic.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Asteroids spawn more frequently and move faster as your score increases.
- **Score System:** Tracks survival time in seconds.
